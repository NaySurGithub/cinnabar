//! Draw destinations on whole physical pixels, where vanilla's UI render context puts them.
//!
//! `MinecraftUIRenderContext::drawImage` (reference 26.30, RVA 0x04437d80) multiplies an image's
//! position by `GuiData`'s GUI scale (+0x5c), truncates it to a whole physical pixel and scales
//! it back by the inverse (+0x60); the size is rounded up to whole pixels the same way:
//! `x' = (int)(x * s) / s`, `w' = ceil(w * s) / s`. `flushText` (0x04436020) truncates text
//! positions the same way. Without it a control centred in an odd free space starts half a GUI
//! unit off the pixel grid, and at an odd GUI scale its quad edges fall on half pixels, where
//! nearest sampling at the texel edge takes the texel outside its uv rect.

/// Float noise from layout arithmetic that must not move a position that is whole in physical
/// pixels (`2.9999998` physical pixels is 3).
